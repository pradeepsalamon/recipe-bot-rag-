> **This is an extension of the app you already built in Week 6.** It is not a build from scratch, and it tests only this week's concepts. Bring your numbers written down.

## 1. Problem statement

Your eval prints a quality score for every generated recipe substitution, and that whole number comes out of an LLM judge nobody has ever checked against a human. The food team is about to publish substitutions on that score alone, and an allergy substitution being wrong is not a rounding error. Prove the judge agrees with you — or find out it doesn't — and move the agreement figure with evidence.


---

## 2. Requirements

1. Bring the eval set to 25+ cases, each tagged with one Week-5 taxonomy mode, and add at least 2 regression cases replayed verbatim from real failed recipe traces; one command still runs everything and prints pass rate by mode.
2. Move at least 2 criteria out of the judge and into deterministic assertions (every ingredient used in the method appears in the ingredient list, allergen warning present when an allergen ingredient is present, oven temperature carries units, servings count echoed and quantities parse as numbers) and delete those criteria from the judge prompt; report the count of assertions vs judged criteria.
3. Hand-label 25 substitutions blind on the judge's single binary criterion and save the labels to a file BEFORE the judge is run — the file's commit or timestamp must prove the ordering.
4. Run the judge, compute agreement with your labels as a percentage, then iterate the judge prompt using 2 of its OWN disagreements as few-shot examples and re-measure; report agreement before -> after as two numbers.
5. File a one-sentence written prediction of what the iteration would fix BEFORE iterating, then report where the prediction was wrong.

## 3. Expected output

labels_25.json (committed first), judge_v1.txt and judge_v2.txt, prediction.txt, the one-command eval table (pass rate by mode), agreement_before and agreement_after as numbers, and a short note on 2 disagreements naming who was right.


---

## 4. Evaluation rubric

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Blind protocol: 25 hand labels exist and provably predate the judge run (commit order / timestamps). No ordering evidence = 0 here, regardless of the numbers. | 25 |
| Agreement measured and reported before -> after, with the iteration driven by the judge's own disagreements as examples | 30 |
| Assertion/judge split: assertable criteria named, implemented as assertions, and removed from the judge prompt | 20 |
| Disagreement analysis: 2+ disagreements read, a verdict on who was right, and the prediction honestly scored against the outcome | 15 |
| Eval still runs in one command over 25+ mode-tagged cases including real regression cases | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

*Zero points for polish, UI, or "it works". This mirrors the House rubric: failure-finding and a number that moved are what score.*

## 5. Bonus challenge

Add RAGAS faithfulness and context precision to the cases backed by your recipe corpus. Find one substitution that scores 0.9+ faithfulness while grounding itself in the wrong recipe's method — confidently, faithfully wrong — and show the two numbers plus why the overall average hides it.


---

## 6. Submission checklist

- [ ] labels_25.json with the commit hash or timestamp proving it predates the judge run
- [ ] judge_v1.txt and judge_v2.txt, diffed, with the 2 disagreement examples visible in v2
- [ ] prediction.txt written before the iteration
- [ ] Terminal output of the single eval command showing pass rate by mode
- [ ] agreement_before / agreement_after, plus assertion count vs judged criteria count


---

## 7. Common mistakes

- **Running the judge first, reading its verdicts, then writing 25 labels — that is not validation, that is agreeing with yourself with extra steps.**
- **Reaching 85% by relabelling the substitutions you disagreed on instead of fixing the judge — you moved the ruler, not the thing being measured.**
- **Paying a model to check whether an allergen warning string is present or whether quantities parse — `if` does that for free and never has an off day.**
- **Scoring substitution quality 1-10 and calling within-1 a match; the model cannot tell a 6 from a 7 and neither can you, and the tolerance inflates agreement into meaninglessness.**
- **Reporting one overall pass rate; the average will happily hide a regression on the allergen-safety mode while the flavour-plausibility mode carries the number.**
